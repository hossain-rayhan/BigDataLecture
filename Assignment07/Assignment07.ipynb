    "For this assignment, you must work in groups of one or two students. Each person is responsible to write their own code, but the group will (together) discuss their solution.  In this notebook, we provide you with basic functions for completing the assignment.  *Complete the assignment in this notebook.  You will need to modify existing code and write new code to find a solution*.  Each member of the group must upload their own work (i.e., a notebook file) to GitHub.\n",

    "*Note: Running a cell will not rerun previous cells.  If you edit code in previous cells, you must rerun those cells.  If you are having trouble with undefined errors and code changes not applying, we recommend using* `Run All` *to avoid any errors results from not rerunning previous cells.  You can find this in the menu above:* `Cell -> Run All`\n",

    "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a cross-sectional survey that is conducted every two years in the United States. As part of the survey, individuals are asked to complete a demographics questionnaire and a 24-hour dietary recall. The 24-hour dietary recalls have been shown to be a valid and reliable method for describing usual dietary intakes of a population.  Given the tens of thousands of different foods an individual may report in the NHANES dietary recall data, it is beneficial to group (i.e., cluster) similar foods based on macronutrient (and somethings micronutrient) content.  These food groups can be used to gain new insight into the dietary patterns of individuals and populations.  For example, if an individual eats only foods in the \"high fat, low carbohydrate\" group we may conclude that this individual is on the [ketogenic diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet).\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a subset of all the food items which are reported in the NHANES dietary recall data.  The data is stored in a tab delimited file and each row contains information for a single food item.  The information we provide is listed in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature      | Description                                                              |\n",
    "|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Food Code    | USDA provided 8-digit code that uniquely identifies each food item       |\n",
    "| Carbohydrate | Carbohydrate content of food, in grams of carbohydrates per gram of food |\n",
    "| Fat          | Fat content of food, in grams of fat per gram of food                    |\n",
    "| Description  | A text description of the food item                                      |\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many real world datasets, the NHANES dietary data exhibits characteristics which make analysis more difficult.  Data are missing values (e.g., certain values do not exist in the data), data features are on different scales or units (e.g., carbohydrates are reported in mg and fats are reported in g), and data values are invalid (e.g., the grams of fat for a food item was incorrectly recorded during data collection).  To perform effective data analysis, these factors must be considered.  We have normalized the data and removed invalid values for you.  The data is presented in 3 files and each line in a file contains information for one food item.  The first data file, `./data/data-1.csv`, contains all of the data (i.e., there are no missing values).  The second and third file, `./data/data-2.csv` and `./data/data-3.csv`, contain food items that are missing values for fat and carbohydrate content.  *In this assignment, you will need to develop methods to fix the problem of missing values in a dataset and cluster the food data based on macronutrient content.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we give code to help you get started.  We start a *Spark Context*, `sc`, and provide a function to load the data into a *Spark RDD* as a `(key, value)` pair.  The `key` is a tuple of `(food code, description)` and the value is a numpy array of `np.array([carbohydrate, fat])`.  It is important to note that we mark missing values in the NHANES dataset with a placeholder value: `np.nan`.  If you attempt to cluster the data without dealing with these missing values, you will encounter error messages."
